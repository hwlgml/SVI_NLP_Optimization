This study was inspired by research conducted based on 'A New Simple Approach for Constructing Implied Volatility Surfaces' by Peter Carr and Liuren Wu.

I. Research Background and Objectives
1.1 Background
1.1.1. 1987 Black Monday: Highlighted the risks of extreme volatility, which can cause sudden market shocks. 1.1.2. Recent Volatility (August 5, 2024): Global markets, especially tech stocks, experienced sharp declines, with the VIX surging over 65%. 1.1.3. Limitations of Black-Scholes Model: Assumes constant volatility, failing to account for the asymmetric and extreme volatility patterns observed in real markets, leading to option mispricing and arbitrage opportunities. 1.1.4. Introduction of SVI Model: The Stochastic Volatility Inspired (SVI) model addresses some of these limitations by dynamically modeling implied volatility and explaining the volatility smile in extreme market conditions. 1.1.5. Need for Improvement: Even the SVI model has limitations in fully capturing volatility asymmetry. Hence, this study proposes a Post-SVI model incorporating 'Convex Duality' to improve option pricing and dynamic hedging in extreme volatility scenarios.

1.2 Research Objectives
1.2.1. Improve Option Pricing Accuracy: The goal is to enhance option pricing during extreme volatility conditions using the Post-SVI model, incorporating convexity duality to better estimate implied volatility. 1.2.2. Eliminate Arbitrage Opportunities: By improving the modeling of volatility smiles and addressing mispricing, the study aims to create an arbitrage-free environment. 1.2.3. Enhance Dynamic Delta Hedging: Utilize real-time dynamic delta hedging strategies based on the refined Post-SVI model to improve risk management and market stability during volatile periods.

II. Literature Review
2.1 Arbitrage-Free SVI Volatility Surfaces
2.1.1. SVI and Static Arbitrage:
Jim Gatheral and Antoine Jacquier's work on "Arbitrage-Free SVI Volatility Surfaces" demonstrates how SVI can be used to prevent static arbitrage in options pricing. The SVI model ensures no arbitrage opportunities arise by fitting well with market data.
